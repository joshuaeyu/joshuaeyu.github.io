title: "Joshua E. Yu"

## Welcome!

My name is Josh, and I'm currently pursuing an M.S. in Computer Science at the Georgia Institute of Technology through its OMSCS program. My aim is to apply math- and science-based theory to software in areas such as computer graphics and machine learning. 

I am actively seeking entry level or internship roles in software engineering.

Previously, I earned a B.S. in Chemical Engineering from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). Upon graduating, I worked at Takeda Pharmaceutical Company in multiple technical operations roles, the longest and most recent of which was as an Automation Engineer.

## Projects

<article markdown="block">

### ["Plum" - A simple graphics engine](https://github.com/joshuaeyu/plum){:target="_blank"}
[![Plum graphics engine screenshot](/graphics/screenshot0.png "Plum graphics engine screenshot"){:.project-image}](https://github.com/joshuaeyu/plum){:target="_blank"}

Plum is a simple real-time graphics engine which I developed using OpenGL 4.1 and C++17. It features a deferred rendering pipeline and physically based shading. Users can instantiate lights, primitives, and models into the scene from the engine's GUI.

### [Optimizing Neural Network Learning with Clustering and Dimensional Reduction](unsupervised_learning)

[!["Neural network performance table"](/graphics/neuralnetwork_dimred_clustering.png "Clustering scatter plot for Dry Bean"){:.project-image-large}](unsupervised_learning)

This is an overview of my work on the corresponding assignment in *CS 7641: Machine Learning* at the Georgia Institute of Technology. This project demonstrates how unsupervised learning techniques such as clustering and dimensionality reduction can be used to optimize supervised learning for two datasets available on the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository.

### [Structural and Numerical Emphases in Optimization Problems](randomized_optimization)
[!["Randomized optimization: Convergence at different problem sizes"](/graphics/problemsize_curves.png "Randomized optimization: Convergence at different problem sizes"){:.project-image}](randomized_optimization)

This project compares three randomized optimization strategies—Random Restart Hill Climbing, Simulated Annealing, and Genetic Algorithms—by applying them to three optimization problems—Six Peaks, Knapsack, and neural network weight optimization.

### [Spider-Man Minigame](https://github.com/joshuaeyu/cs174a-spiderman-minigame)

[![Spider-Man minigame screenshot](/graphics/screenshot1.png "Spider-Man minigame screenshot"){:.project-image}](https://github.com/joshuaeyu/cs174a-spiderman-minigame){:target="_blank"}

This was my team's final project in *COM SCI 174A: Introduction to Computer Graphics* at UCLA. We implemented physics, swinging and wall-climbing mechanics, collision detection, audio, and player/camera controls on top of the WebGL-based graphics library that was provided by the course.
