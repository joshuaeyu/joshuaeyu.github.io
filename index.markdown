title: "Joshua E. Yu"

## Welcome!

My name is Josh, and I'm currently pursuing an M.S. in Computer Science at the Georgia Institute of Technology through its OMSCS program. My aim is to apply math- and science-based theory to software in areas such as computer graphics and machine learning. 

I am actively seeking entry level or internship roles in software engineering.

Previously, I earned a B.S. in Chemical Engineering from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). Upon graduating, I worked at Takeda Pharmaceutical Company in multiple technical operations roles, the longest and most recent of which was as an Automation Engineer.

## Projects

<article markdown="block">

### ["Plum" - A simple graphics engine](https://github.com/joshuaeyu/plum){:target="_blank"}
[![Plum graphics engine screenshot](/graphics/screenshot0.png "Plum graphics engine screenshot"){:.project-image}](https://github.com/joshuaeyu/plum){:target="_blank"}

Plum is a simple real-time graphics engine built using OpenGL 4.1 and C++17. It features a deferred rendering pipeline and physically based shading. Users can instantiate lights, primitives, and models into the scene from the engine's GUI.

### [Augmenting Neural Network Learning with Clustering and Dimensional Reduction](unsupervised_learning)


[!["Neural network performance table"](/graphics/neuralnetwork_dimred_clustering.png "Clustering scatter plot for Dry Bean"){:.project-image}](unsupervised_learning)

This project compares the effectiveness of two clustering strategies—Expectation-Maximization and *k*-Means—and three dimensionality reduction methods—Random Projection, Principal Component Analysis, and Independent Component Analysis—by applying them to two datasets available on the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository.

### [Structural and Numerical Emphases in Optimization Problems](randomized_optimization)
[!["Randomized optimization: Convergence at different problem sizes"](/graphics/problemsize_curves.png "Randomized optimization: Convergence at different problem sizes"){:.project-image}](randomized_optimization)

This project compares three randomized optimization strategies—Random Restart Hill Climbing, Simulated Annealing, and Genetic Algorithms—by applying them to three optimization problems—Six Peaks, Knapsack, and neural network weight optimization.
