# Augmenting Neural Network Learning with Clustering and Dimensional Reduction

Unsupervised learning encompasses a wide range of techniques which aim to draw conclusions from unlabeled data, and each technique can have many approaches in itself. 

**Clustering** is a technique which attempts to partition data into groupings based on some notion of similarity; some clustering approaches include hierarchical clustering, *k*-means clustering, and Gaussian mixture models. 

**Dimensionality reduction** attempts to transform a set of features into a more simplified representation while preserving as much of the underlying signals in the original data as possible. Some approaches include random projection, principal component analysis (PCA), and independent component analysis (ICA).

On this page, I will summarize my work and findings for the Unsupervised Learning assignment in Georgia Tech's CS 7641 course. In this assignment, I chose to explore the [Dry Bean](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/602/dry+bean+dataset){:target="_blank"} and [Estimation of Obesity Levels Based On Eating Habits and Physical Condition](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/544/estimation+of+obesity+levels+based+on+eating+habits+and+physical+condition){:target="_blank"} ("Obesity") datasets from the [UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu){:target="_blank"}.

## Clustering

Clustering on its own is useful for deriving meaningful groupings of examples in an unlabeled dataset. However, as shown here, it can also be useful as a preprocessing stage for supervised learning of labeled datasets.
